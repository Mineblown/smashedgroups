  "rules": "<u>Blackouts & Backshots: The Anti-Chaos Guidelines</u><br><br><b>18+ ONLY! </b>Seriously, if you're still sipping juice boxes, get out. This is a drinking world group and a mature space. No exceptions.<br><br><b>Keep the Vibe Positive <i>(and Civil)</i>. </b>Drama is a guaranteed vibe-killer, and we're not running a soap opera. Take your nonsense to the DMs. Keep the public chat fun.<br><br><b>Harassment is a Hard NO.</b> Respect boundaries, respect consent, and don't be disruptive. This is a place for enjoyment, not discomfort. Get it?<br><br><b>No Spamming.</b> Nobody wants to see your twelve identical emotes or walls of text. Keep the chat clean and engaging for everyone.<br><br><b>No Shady Links. </b>If it smells illegal or dodgy, don't post it. Keep that sketchy garbage out of our server.<br><br><b>ZERO TOLERANCE for Hate Speech!</b> Racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, or any bigoted crap gets you launched into the digital sun. You will be kicked immediately.<br><br><b>Keep Religion and Politics Civil. </b>If you insist on bringing up topics that make people want to fight, keep the tone light. If it gets heated, use the block buttonâ€”it exists for a reason!<br><br><b>No Bad-Mouthing Other Groups.</b> Don't air your beef here. Keep things professional and take your concerns to DMs. We're focused on our own brand of awesome, not petty feuds.<br><br><b>Grow Up!</b> Immaturity will not be tolerated. This means no passive-aggressive nonsense, no starting drama in public chats, and no playing the victim over minor things. If you can't handle adult interactions, this isn't the server for you.<br><br><b>Blocking Staff:</b> As a guest, you have the right to block staff you don't jive with. But you MUST alert another staff member immediately so we know what's up and who's talking to whom.<br><br>Follow these rules, and we'll all continue to have a glorious, chaotic time. Don't, and you'll find out what the ban hammer tastes like. You've been warned.",
  "infoBoard": "Alright, listen up, you degenerates! You've stumbled upon the Virtual Vixens, and let me tell ya, we're not here for your grandma's tea party. If you're looking for a group that embraces the glorious chaos of public nudity and drunken absurdity, you've found your new digital home.<br><br>Think of us as the love child of a drinking group and a lewd group, but with absolutely no filter. We're free, we're open, and we're probably already three shots deep. So if you're ready to shed your inhibitions (and maybe your clothes) and dive headfirst into some virtual debauchery, come on in. Just don't say I didn't warn you. This ain't for the faint of heart, but it's gonna be one hell of a ride.",
