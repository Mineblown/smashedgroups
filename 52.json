I wanna give a <b>HUGE </b>thank you to everyone who continues to party with us, anytime we pop up. I originally started this group with love in my heart, and I'm thankful I did. After meeting so many of you, it makes my heart warm knowing that you all still come back and share stories of times you have drank with us. Thank you for being absolutely wonderful to us. Thank you to our staff, the other owners, and you, our wonderful members, for being here and joining in on our journey. I love you from the bottom of my heart <3. 3 CHEEEERS! </color>",
